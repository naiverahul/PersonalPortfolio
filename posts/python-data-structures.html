  <p>Understanding Python's built-in data structures is essential for writing efficient and elegant code. In this post, I'll explain the various data structures available in Python, their time complexities, and when to use each one.</p>
  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>Lists are the workhorse of Python data structures. They're mutable, ordered, and can contain elements of different types.</p>
  <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
  <p>Dictionaries are key-value stores that provide fast lookups by key.</p>
  <h2>Sets</h2>
  <p>Sets are unordered collections of unique elements with fast membership testing.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Choosing the right data structure for your specific use case can significantly improve your code's performance and readability.</p>
