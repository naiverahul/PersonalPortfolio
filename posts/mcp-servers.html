  <p>The future of LLMs isn't just about generating textâ€”it's about integrating tools and real-time systems. Meet the <strong>MCP Server</strong>â€”a modular bridge that connects Claude with real-world APIs like search engines and databases.</p>
  <h2>What is an MCP Server?</h2>
  <p>MCP stands for <strong>Modular Command Processor</strong>. It's a thin service layer that listens for tool requests from Claude or any LLM that supports tool use. It then executes external logic (like a web search) and returns the results back to the model.</p>
  <h2>How MCP Architecture Works</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>The user sends a query to Claude (via CLI or Web UI).</li>
      <li>Claude evaluates the query and decides to use a tool (e.g., web search).</li>
      <li>Claude sends a tool-use request to the MCP server with parameters.</li>
      <li>MCP routes the request to the appropriate tool logic (like DuckDuckGo API).</li>
      <li>The response is returned and Claude continues the conversation with new context.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This architecture allows Claude to simulate reasoning and perform real-time information retrieval while remaining stateless on its own.</p>
