  <p>Ever wondered how your neural network knows it’s making mistakes? That’s where <strong>labels</strong> and <strong>loss functions</strong> come into play. Let’s dive into what they are and why choosing the right combo matters.</p>
  <h2>What Are Labels?</h2>
  <p>Labels (or <em>targets</em>) are the ground-truth values you want your model to predict. They come in various flavors: Integral (Sparse), One-Hot, Multi-Hot, etc.</p>
  <h2>What Are Loss Functions?</h2>
  <p>A <strong>loss function</strong> measures the gap between your model’s predictions and the true labels. During training, we <strong>minimize</strong> this loss to make the model smarter.</p>
  <h2>Why Matching Matters</h2>
  <p>Using the wrong loss-label pairing can lead to training errors or suboptimal performance. Aligning your labels with the right loss function is like picking the perfect dance partner—they move in sync!</p>
  <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Labels</strong> are your ground truth; choose based on the task.</li>
      <li><strong>Loss functions</strong> tell your model how wrong it is; pick one that matches your label type.</li>
      <li><strong>Pair wisely</strong> to save memory and ensure proper learning.</li>
  </ol>
