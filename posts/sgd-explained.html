  <p>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the most important algorithms in machine learning, particularly for training neural networks. In this post, we'll explore how SGD works and why it's so effective.</p>
  <h2>What is Gradient Descent?</h2>
  <p>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.</p>
  <h2>The "Stochastic" in SGD</h2>
  <p>While traditional gradient descent computes the gradient using the entire dataset, stochastic gradient descent approximates the gradient using a single sample or a small batch. This makes the algorithm faster and more memory-efficient.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Stochastic Gradient Descent is a cornerstone algorithm in modern machine learning. By understanding how it works, you can improve the training of your models and tackle more complex problems.</p>
