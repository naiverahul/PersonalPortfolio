  <p>Building a maze-solving robot is an excellent way to learn about robotics, sensors, and algorithms. In this post, I'll share my experience building a robot that can navigate through complex mazes autonomously.</p>
  <h2>Robot Hardware Components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Microcontroller (Arduino)</li>
    <li>Infrared sensors for wall detection</li>
    <li>DC motors for movement</li>
    <li>Motor drivers</li>
    <li>Battery pack</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>PID Control for Smooth Navigation</h2>
  <p>To ensure smooth navigation, I implemented a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller that adjusts the motor speeds based on sensor readings. This allows the robot to make smooth turns and maintain a consistent distance from walls.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Building a maze-solving robot is a challenging but rewarding project. The combination of hardware integration, algorithm implementation, and control theory provides a comprehensive learning experience.</p>
